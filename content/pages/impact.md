          "There were times in my college career where I feared if my education
          would have to come to an end due to financial reasons, but the
          financial assistance you have provided me has helped me tremendously
          and allowed me to keep going. Because of what you have done for me I
          can follow my dream and graduate with my undergraduate degree in the
          spring of 2023."
