intro: >
  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU's) are an oasis of cultural
  significance, both past and present, and are leading sources for black
  graduates. However, the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math
  (STEM) are still lacking proper representation of minority and
  underrepresented groups.


  The HBCU STEM Education Run (STEMER) is a virtual run/walk that strives to
  raise funds and awareness through fitness. Funds are collected in the form of
  registration fees, sponsorship money, and pledges. Funds raised will be used
  to educate, empower, and elevate HBCU students through scholarships and career
  resources.
