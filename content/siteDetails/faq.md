  - question: What is a virtual race or walkathon?
    answer: >
      Walking or running for a cause is an exciting, rewarding fundraising
      experience. The advantage of a virtual event is that it can be done
      anywhere! Participants also have the full month of May (HBCU STEMER) or
      October (Women in STEM Walkathon) to either run or rack up as many miles
      as possible. Then we turn your miles into money.
